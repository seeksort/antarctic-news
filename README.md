To start the server, run an instance of MongoDB on your machine (typically `mongod` on the command line) so that the app can write to the database. The app will also seed the database whenever the server is started. In a separate tab, run:

    npm run start

Then, to compile Webpack, run:

    npm run build

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to view the app.
